HoldUp : Ethereum Staking App

## Overview

Welcome to the Ethereum Staking App, a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain. This app allows users to stake their Ethereum and earn interest over a chosen duration. Users can lock their ETH for 30, 60, or 90 days and receive attractive interest rates.

## Features

- Stake Ethereum: Users can easily stake their Ethereum within the app.
  
- Lock Period Options: Users can choose to lock their ETH for 30, 60, or 90 days.

- Earn Interest: During the chosen lock period, users will earn interest on their staked Ethereum.

- Flexibility: While staked, users won't be able to earn interest, but they can freely unstake their ETH at any time.

## Getting Started

To use the Ethereum Staking App, follow these simple steps:

1. Connect Wallet: Connect your Ethereum wallet to the app.

2. Stake ETH: Choose the amount of Ethereum you want to stake and select the lock period (30, 60, or 90 days).

3. Earn Interest: Watch your staked Ethereum grow with interest during the lock period.

4. Unstake ETH: If needed, you can unstake your Ethereum at any time. Keep in mind that unstaking forfeits any remaining interest.

## Technologies Used

- Smart Contracts: The staking functionality is powered by Ethereum smart contracts.
  
- Web3 Integration: The app seamlessly interacts with the Ethereum blockchain through Web3 [ether.js,mocha.js,chai.js,ReactJs].

- Tools: Hardhat, Alchemy 


## Development
